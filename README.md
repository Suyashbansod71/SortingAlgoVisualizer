# Sorting-Algo-Visualizer

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
You can learn more in the Create React App documentation (https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/)

## Description
The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a web application that aims to simplify the understanding of sorting algorithms through interactive visualizations. 
With a user-friendly UI, this project allows users to create arrays with random values and visualize the sorting process of various algorithms in real-time.

## Key Features

• **Interactive UI**: The project boasts a simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to easily create arrays with random values and select their desired sorting algorithm.

• **Real-time Visualization**: Users can watch the sorting algorithms in action, as the visualizations provide a step-by-step representation of the sorting process. This helps in better grasping the inner workings of each algorithm.

• **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: The visualizer supports various popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and more. Users can compare different algorithms side by side to observe their efficiency and differences.

Tech Stack: Developed using JavaScript for the functionality, HTML for the structure, and CSS for styling, this project is lightweight and easily accessible.
